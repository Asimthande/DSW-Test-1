Component Hierarchy
App: Navigation container, no state

HomeScreen: Manages product list state, fetches data, passes products to ProductCards

ProductCard: Receives product data via props, displays preview, triggers navigation

DetailScreen: Receives product ID via navigation, manages detailed product state, fetches specific product data

State Management
HomeScreen holds: products array, loading status, error state

DetailScreen holds: single product object, loading status, error state

State flows downward via props from screens to display components

Navigation parameters pass IDs between screens

Data Flow
HomeScreen fetches all products → stores in state → passes to ProductCards via props

ProductCard press → navigates to DetailScreen with product ID parameter

DetailScreen uses ID → fetches specific product details → stores in state → displays

Key Principles
Single source of truth for each data set

Unidirectional data flow (parent to child via props)

Separation of concerns (data management vs presentation)

Minimal state needed in each component
